Assume we have X MB memory to use. So, here is the detail how I implement itï¼š
1. we would divide the whole file into K parts, and K * X = 2 GB. we would load one part into memory each time.
use a sort method which time cost is O(nlogn) so sort the part of file. And then, we save it in a file.
2. we load the next file and sort it.
3. After we sort all part of file, we can merge them together.
