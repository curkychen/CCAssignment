	 * 
	 * Assume that if we don't cut off that two squares, we can use
	 * 32 dominos to cover the entire board, which means each domino
	 * can exactly cover one black square and one white square, it
	 * would must happen. But if two diagonally opposite corners have
	 * been cut off, we only left 32 white squares and 30 black squares.
	 * If we put each domino on the board, it still would cover exact one
	 * black square and one white square. Finally, we would find that we can 
	 * use only one domino to cover two black square. So, it is impossible.
