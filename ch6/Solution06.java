	 * First, we assume that there is only one blue-eyed men.
	 * If he found that there is no one has blue eye, he will
	 * immediately realize that he is the men who has blue eye.
	 * he would leave that night immediately.
	 * 
	 * Second, if there are two blue-eyed men. if the blue-eyed men
	 * saw there is one men who has blue eye, base on the first case, 
	 * he know the other blue-eyed men would leave at first night. But
	 * at the second, they still he. So the guy who has blue eye would know
	 * there are 2 men has blue eye, so they would both left at second night.
	 * 
	 * finally, for c blue-eyed men. They would also wait c night to observe other
	 * blue-eyed guys situation. Once they realize that there are c blue-eyed men, and
	 * they would leave toghter.
	 * 
	 * So, the c blue-eyed men take c night.
